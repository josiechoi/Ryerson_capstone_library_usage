The Lit Review can take a few directions. For instance 
## What has been done so far with this dataset
* There are a few kernels available through Kaggle, but most of these kernels/notebooks were created three years ago. 
## What do we know about SFPL? 
* A crucial element, in addition to mathematics and programming skills, is domain knowledge. In particular, when working with this dataset,  it is important to have background information about the organization, San Francisco Public Library (SFPL). 
## What do we know about driving forces behind library activities? 
* Here, defined as number of checkouts and may number of renewals
* Ideally, we can find literature about studies done in the area of public libraries. If there is none, a broader scope (which covers all kind of libraries) will be used.
